The Machine Learning group at Edinburgh (https://github.com/mast-group) has 
developed tools for automatic code summarisation, which takes the source code 
of a software project and decides on boilerplate blocks to be folded away. 

This web application uses this tool to display summarised source code, and allows 
programmers to skim through GitHub projects at different levels of detail.

A full description of the project can be found in dissertation.pdf

This whole folder goes into tomcat/webapps, from then on should work by 
itself.
